 # oGasai Scripts for WoW Classic
 Ogasaism

 Current known bugs - 
 - druid double casts healing touch and can waste mana in clutch situations
 - checkbox to avoid blacklisted targets causes bot to walk circles around the target with no clear path to continue grinding
 - sometimes when creating a new hotspot (while moving) the bot does not understand you are at a hotspot and need to manually move out of range or change hotspots to resolve
 - bot does not and CANNOT detect water and will navigate on the floor and drown - this is not fixable but can be negated with aquatic form or water breathing potions or underwater breathing spells
 - no clear path to avoid elites and will sometimes get stuck until a new target is acquired
 - runner script, which was not functional to begin with, has been repurposed for aggro checking during combat and needs to be removed from script options

A good idea to get a decent injector.

This bot will not PvP. This can be adjusted to PvP but I will not do it. The bot "may" choose to attack a player for defensive purposes on a PvP server only. Like with any WoW bot, you can change the bot to do PvP, but this can be extremely detrimental to any community and the purpose of this bot is not to harm any server. My choice of using this bot over others is to learn coding from a basic language like LUA.

# Casters - Obtain a wand ASAP. Can be used level 5+.
